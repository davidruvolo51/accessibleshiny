# Accessible Shiny

*The `accessibleshiny` package is in development. If you would like to get involved, let me know.*

## What's going on here?

The `accessibleshiny` package is a collection of UI components, tools, and methods for improving the accessibility of shiny applications. The components in this package are built with the following concepts in mind.

1. **Web Accessibility:** It is important that Shiny applications can be accessed and used by individuals that use assistive web technologies, such as screen readers, digital braille displays, or other devices/browser extensions. This does not only include input elements and images, but also application UI layouts and data visualizations.
2. **Responsive Design:** In addition to creating components that are accessible, creating responsive content can help improve the accessibility app Shiny apps. The components in this package are optimized for different screen sizes.
3. **Customizable:** Lastly, these components can be customized through CSS to fit the design of your application (e.g., organizational branding, prebuilt themes, etc.).

## What components will be included in this package?

Here are some of the components that I have planned.

- Responsive tables
- Progress Bars (for items complete; TBD)
- Accordions
- Radio Input Buttons
- Checkbox Buttons
- Creating internal links (to other tabs)
- and more!
