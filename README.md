# Accessible Shiny

The accessible shiny package contains a series of accessible ui components for use in shiny applications. This project is in the early days of development and more fun things are on the way! 

Please refer to the wiki for more information about developing the package and for function reference. If you are intersted in helping out, please let me know. 

**The package is working, but I would wait before implementing into any production application before all underlying methods have been thoroughly tested.**

## Installation

You can install the `accessibleshiny` package using the `devtools` package.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("davidruvolo51/accessibleshiny")
```
