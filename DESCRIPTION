Description: This package provides a series of ui components for creating 
    accessible shiny applications. This is important for applications that are
    used by a wider-population (e.g., department, organization, public). The ui 
    components in this package are built on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 
    at the core and allow for custom styling. The components include page layouts,
    inputs, figures, tables and forms. See documentation and website for more
    information.
